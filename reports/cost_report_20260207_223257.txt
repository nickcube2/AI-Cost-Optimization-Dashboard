# AWS Cost Analysis Report

## Key Insights About Spending Patterns

• **Extremely low overall spend**: At $0.85 for 7 days (~$3.65/month), this represents a minimal AWS footprint
• **KMS dominance**: AWS Key Management Service accounts for 87% of costs, which is unusual for most AWS environments
• **Inactive services**: Multiple services (S3, Glue, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, Location Service, SNS) show $0.00 costs, indicating either no usage or usage below billing thresholds
• **Tax burden**: 12.9% tax rate suggests significant regional tax implications on the small spend
• **Development/testing environment**: The cost pattern suggests this is likely a development, testing, or proof-of-concept environment rather than production

## Cost-Saving Recommendations

### 1. **Optimize KMS Key Usage** 
- **Priority: HIGH**
- **Action**: Audit active KMS keys and delete unused customer-managed keys
- **Details**: KMS charges $1/month per customer-managed key. Review all keys and consolidate or eliminate unused ones
- **Estimated Monthly Savings**: $1.00 - $2.00
- **Implementation**: Use AWS CLI `aws kms list-keys` and `aws kms describe-key` to identify unused keys

### 2. **Review KMS Key Rotation and Usage**
- **Priority: MEDIUM** 
- **Action**: Evaluate if automatic key rotation is necessary for all keys
- **Details**: Key rotation adds additional costs. Disable for non-critical/development keys
- **Estimated Monthly Savings**: $0.50 - $1.00
- **Implementation**: Review rotation settings in KMS console for each key

### 3. **Consolidate to AWS Managed Keys Where Possible**
- **Priority: MEDIUM**
- **Action**: Replace customer-managed KMS keys with AWS managed keys for non-critical use cases
- **Details**: AWS managed keys are free for most services (S3, EBS, RDS, etc.)
- **Estimated Monthly Savings**: $1.00 - $3.00
- **Implementation**: Update service configurations to use default AWS managed encryption

### 4. **Resource Cleanup Across All Services**
- **Priority: LOW**
- **Action**: Verify zero-cost services are truly unused and clean up any hidden resources
- **Details**: Check for unattached EBS volumes, old snapshots, or resources in other regions
- **Estimated Monthly Savings**: $0.10 - $0.50
- **Implementation**: Use AWS Cost Explorer and AWS Config to identify orphaned resources

## Summary

**Total Estimated Monthly Savings**: $2.60 - $6.50

**Overall Assessment**: While the absolute savings are small due to minimal usage, implementing these recommendations could reduce your AWS bill by 70-180%. The primary focus should be on KMS optimization since it represents nearly all your current costs. This appears to be a development environment where aggressive cost optimization through service consolidation and cleanup would be most beneficial.

**Next Steps**: 
1. Immediately audit KMS keys (High priority)
2. Plan migration to AWS managed keys where appropriate
3. Implement regular monthly resource cleanup procedures
