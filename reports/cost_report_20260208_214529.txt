AI ANALYSIS & RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📊 SPENDING OVERVIEW
- **Total Monthly Spend**: $6.62 (extremely low for production environment)
- **Trend**: Stable minimal spend suggesting development/testing workload
- **Top 3 Cost Drivers**: 
  1. Amazon EKS: $3.54 (53.5%) - Control plane costs
  2. AWS KMS: $1.82 (27.5%) - Key usage charges
  3. EC2 Other: $0.69 (10.4%) - Likely EBS volumes/snapshots
- **Anomalies**: Unusually high KMS costs (27.5%) relative to compute suggests excessive API calls or over-encryption

## 💰 OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES

### 1. **KMS Key Usage Optimization**
- **What**: AWS KMS API calls and key usage patterns
- **Why**: $1.82/month KMS costs are disproportionate (27.5% of total) for such low compute usage, indicating excessive encrypt/decrypt operations or multiple keys
- **Action**: Audit KMS CloudTrail logs to identify high-frequency API calls, consolidate keys, implement client-side caching for decrypt operations
- **Savings**: $1.00-1.50/month (55-82% reduction)
- **Risk**: Low (optimization only)
- **Effort**: Medium (1-4 hours)

### 2. **EKS Cluster Right-sizing**
- **What**: Amazon EKS control plane
- **Why**: $3.54/month suggests running EKS 24/7 for minimal workload (only $0.41 in compute costs)
- **Action**: Consider EKS Fargate profiles instead of persistent cluster, or migrate to ECS if Kubernetes features aren't required
- **Savings**: $2.50-3.00/month (70-85% reduction)
- **Risk**: High (architecture change)
- **Effort**: Complex (> 4 hours)

### 3. **EBS Volume Cleanup**
- **What**: EC2-Other costs (likely unattached EBS volumes/snapshots)
- **Why**: $0.69/month with minimal EC2 compute suggests orphaned storage resources
- **Action**: Use AWS CLI to identify unattached volumes: `aws ec2 describe-volumes --filters Name=status,Values=available` and delete unused resources
- **Savings**: $0.30-0.50/month (45-75% reduction)
- **Risk**: Low (after verification)
- **Effort**: Quick Win (< 1 hour)

### 4. **Development Environment Scheduling**
- **What**: Entire infrastructure stack
- **Why**: Low overall spend suggests non-production usage that could benefit from scheduling
- **Action**: Implement AWS Instance Scheduler or Lambda functions to stop EKS nodes during off-hours (nights/weekends)
- **Savings**: $1.00-2.00/month (30-50% reduction)
- **Risk**: Medium (requires coordination with dev teams)
- **Effort**: Medium (1-4 hours)

**ROI RANKING**:
1. EBS Volume Cleanup (Quick Win, Low Risk)
2. KMS Optimization (High $ impact, Low Risk)
3. Development Scheduling (Good savings, Medium effort)
4. EKS Architecture Review (Highest savings, but high complexity)

**Note**: Given the extremely low spend ($6.62/month), consider if this is actually a production environment or if data represents partial usage.
