# AWS Cost Optimization Analysis

## Key Insights About Spending Patterns

- **Low overall spend**: $19.23 over 90 days (~$6.41/month) indicates a development or testing environment
- **Container-heavy workload**: EKS dominates spending at 39.3% ($7.55), suggesting Kubernetes-based applications
- **Compute costs are distributed**: Split between EKS ($7.55), EC2 compute ($2.93), and EC2-Other ($3.67)
- **High KMS usage**: $1.83 (9.5%) is disproportionately high for encryption keys in a small environment
- **Minimal storage costs**: S3 showing $0.00 suggests very light data storage usage
- **Tax burden**: $2.48 represents 12.9% of total costs

## Top Cost-Saving Recommendations

### 1. Optimize KMS Key Usage
**Priority: HIGH**
- **Issue**: $1.83/90 days ($0.61/month) for KMS is excessive for a small environment
- **Action**: 
  - Audit active customer-managed keys (CMKs) - each costs $1/month
  - Delete unused keys or schedule for deletion
  - Consider using AWS-managed keys where possible
- **Estimated Monthly Savings**: $0.40-$0.50 (65-80% reduction)

### 2. Right-size EKS Cluster
**Priority: HIGH** 
- **Issue**: $7.55 for EKS over 90 days suggests potential over-provisioning
- **Action**:
  - Review EKS node group instance types and scaling policies
  - Implement cluster autoscaler if not already present
  - Consider Fargate for sporadic workloads vs EC2 nodes
  - Use Spot instances for non-critical workloads (up to 90% savings)
- **Estimated Monthly Savings**: $0.50-$1.00

### 3. Analyze EC2 Instance Utilization
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- **Issue**: $6.60 total EC2 costs (compute + other) may include underutilized instances
- **Action**:
  - Use CloudWatch metrics to identify low-utilization instances
  - Implement auto-scaling for variable workloads
  - Schedule dev/test instances to run only during business hours
  - Consider smaller instance types for development workloads
- **Estimated Monthly Savings**: $0.30-$0.60

### 4. Optimize Load Balancer Usage
**Priority: LOW**
- **Issue**: $0.05 for ELB suggests minimal usage but potential inefficiency
- **Action**:
  - Evaluate if Application Load Balancer is necessary for current traffic
  - Consider using EKS ingress controller instead of separate ALB
  - Consolidate multiple load balancers if present
- **Estimated Monthly Savings**: $0.02-$0.05

### 5. Review VPC Costs
**Priority: LOW**
- **Issue**: $0.69 for VPC costs may indicate NAT Gateway usage
- **Action**:
  - Audit NAT Gateway necessity for development environment
  - Consider NAT instance for lower-traffic scenarios
  - Review data transfer patterns and optimize
- **Estimated Monthly Savings**: $0.10-$0.20

## Summary

**Total Estimated Monthly Savings**: $1.32-$2.35 (62-110% of current monthly spend)

**Immediate Actions** (High Priority):
1. Audit and cleanup KMS keys
2. Review EKS node sizing and implement spot instances

**Quick Wins**:
- The small scale of this environment makes it ideal for aggressive optimization
- Focus on the top 3 services (EKS, EC2, KMS) which represent 73.6% of costs
- Consider if this is a development environment that could be shut down outside business hours

**Note**: Given the low absolute costs, balance optimization effort with potential savings. Focus on high-impact, low-effort changes first.
