# AWS Cost Optimization Analysis

## Key Insights About Spending Patterns

• **Low overall spend** ($6.62/month) indicates a development or small-scale environment
• **EKS-heavy workload** with 53.5% of costs going to Kubernetes infrastructure
• **High KMS costs relative to total spend** at 27.5% suggests potential over-provisioning of encryption keys
• **Minimal storage costs** ($0.00 S3) indicates efficient storage usage or very low data volumes
• **Small EC2 footprint** with only $1.10 total across compute and other EC2 services

## Top Cost-Saving Recommendations

### 1. Optimize KMS Key Usage
**Priority: HIGH**
- **Issue**: $1.82/month on KMS (27.5% of total spend) is disproportionately high
- **Action**: 
  - Audit active KMS keys and delete unused customer-managed keys ($1/key/month)
  - Consider using AWS-managed keys for non-sensitive workloads where possible
  - Consolidate keys if multiple keys are being used for similar purposes
- **Estimated Savings**: $1.00-$1.50/month
- **Implementation**: Review key usage in KMS console, identify unused keys

### 2. Right-size EKS Cluster
**Priority: HIGH**
- **Issue**: $3.54/month EKS spend might indicate over-provisioned worker nodes
- **Action**:
  - Implement Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Cluster Autoscaler
  - Review worker node instance types and sizes
  - Consider using Spot instances for non-critical workloads (up to 90% savings)
  - Use Fargate for sporadic workloads instead of persistent worker nodes
- **Estimated Savings**: $1.00-$2.00/month
- **Implementation**: Enable cluster autoscaling, analyze pod resource requests/limits

### 3. Audit EC2 Resources
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- **Issue**: $0.69 in "EC2 - Other" costs may include unattached resources
- **Action**:
  - Check for unattached EBS volumes and delete unnecessary ones
  - Review and delete old EBS snapshots (especially automated ones >30 days)
  - Identify any idle or underutilized EC2 instances
- **Estimated Savings**: $0.30-$0.50/month
- **Implementation**: Use AWS Cost Explorer and EC2 console to identify orphaned resources

### 4. Implement Reserved Capacity (Future Planning)
**Priority: LOW**
- **Issue**: All compute appears to be on-demand pricing
- **Action**:
  - Monitor usage patterns for 2-3 months
  - Consider EKS Savings Plans or EC2 Reserved Instances if usage becomes predictable
  - Start with 1-year terms for flexibility
- **Estimated Savings**: $0.20-$0.40/month (20-30% of compute costs)
- **Implementation**: Use AWS Cost Explorer recommendations after establishing usage patterns

## Summary

**Total Estimated Monthly Savings**: $2.50-$4.40 (38-66% reduction)
**Highest Impact**: Focus on KMS optimization and EKS right-sizing first
**Quick Wins**: Delete unused KMS keys and implement cluster autoscaling

Given the low spend volume, prioritize the high-impact recommendations that require minimal ongoing management. The KMS optimization alone could reduce your bill by 15-23%.
