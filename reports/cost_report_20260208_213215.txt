AI ANALYSIS & RECOMMENDATIONS

## 📊 SPENDING OVERVIEW

- **Total Monthly Spend**: $6.62 with relatively low overall AWS usage
- **Top 3 Cost Drivers**: 
  1. Amazon EKS: $3.54 (53.5%) - Kubernetes cluster management
  2. AWS KMS: $1.82 (27.5%) - Key management operations
  3. EC2 - Other: $0.69 (10.4%) - Supporting EC2 resources
- **Unusual Patterns**: Disproportionately high KMS costs (27.5%) for a $6.62 environment suggests excessive key operations or over-provisioned key usage

## 💰 OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES

### 1. KMS Key Usage Optimization
**What**: AWS KMS key operations and potentially unused keys
**Why**: $1.82/month KMS cost is unusually high for a $6.62 environment, suggesting excessive API calls or unused customer-managed keys
**Action**: 
- Audit KMS usage via CloudTrail logs in KMS console
- Identify and delete unused customer-managed keys
- Reduce encryption/decryption API calls by implementing caching
**Savings**: $0.50-1.00/month (30-55% reduction)
**Risk**: Medium (ensure keys aren't needed before deletion)
**Effort**: Medium (2-3 hours for audit and cleanup)

### 2. EKS Cluster Right-sizing
**What**: Amazon EKS cluster configuration
**Why**: $3.54/month suggests a single EKS cluster ($0.10/hour = $72/month for control plane, but only seeing $3.54 indicates partial usage or dev environment)
**Action**: 
- Review EKS cluster utilization in EKS console
- Consider EKS Fargate for variable workloads vs EC2 nodes
- Evaluate if development workloads can share clusters
**Savings**: $1.00-2.00/month (reduce to minimal viable configuration)
**Risk**: Low (if properly tested in dev environment first)
**Effort**: Medium (2-4 hours for analysis and optimization)

### 3. EC2 Instance Optimization
**What**: EC2 compute instances and associated resources
**Why**: Combined EC2 costs ($0.41 + $0.69 = $1.10) suggest small instances that may be over-provisioned or running continuously
**Action**:
- Check EC2 instances in console for CPU/memory utilization
- Implement start/stop scheduling for non-production instances
- Consider t3.nano or t4g.nano for light workloads
**Savings**: $0.30-0.50/month
**Risk**: Low (with proper scheduling configuration)
**Effort**: Quick Win (< 1 hour)

### 4. VPC NAT Gateway Review
**What**: VPC networking costs
**Why**: $0.03/month suggests minimal data transfer, but verify no unused NAT gateways exist
**Action**: Review VPC console for unused NAT gateways, consider NAT instances for low-traffic scenarios
**Savings**: $0.01-0.02/month (minimal but good practice)
**Risk**: Low
**Effort**: Quick Win (15 minutes)

**ROI Ranking**: 
1. EC2 Optimization (Quick Win, $0.30-0.50 savings)
2. KMS Cleanup (Medium effort, $0.50-1.00 savings) 
3. EKS Right-sizing (Medium effort, $1.00-2.00 savings)
4. VPC Review (Quick Win, minimal savings but good hygiene)
